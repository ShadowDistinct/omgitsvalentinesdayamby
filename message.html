        <p>Im sorry if its lackluster, i tried my best i had many ideas that i thought youd like but either i didnt feel confident that youll like it or that im just not capable of doing. I love you im sure you know that, i feel very demotivated the past few days im sure you know why im sorry. i didnt even add a favicon because of this again im sorry. I dont know what to write here im very terrible at this i wish i could do better and give you something that youd like. Ill do better next year i swear, anyway have a good valentine day and mwah i love you <3 (also sorry not sorry for making it look like this LOL) </p>
